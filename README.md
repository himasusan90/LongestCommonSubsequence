# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) in C#

This repository contains the implementation of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm in C#. The LCS problem is a classic computer science problem, which is a subproblem of edit distance and has applications in various fields such as bioinformatics, text comparison, and version control.

The repository includes two different approaches to solve the LCS problem:

1. **Recursive Method**: A straightforward approach that follows the natural recursive definition of the problem.
2. **Dynamic Programming Method**: An optimized approach that uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.
